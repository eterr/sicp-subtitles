  * What is SICP?

    Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, an epochal textbook in programming, with full full text [http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html available online]. For the cultural impact, see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SICP Wikipedia article].

  
  * What are the SICP videos?

    These are the video lectures by SICP authors, Abelson and Sussman, also freely available [http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures online].


  * Where do I get the subtitles to SICP?

    We have not yet completed producing those. When the work is finished, the subtitles will be packaged into convenient downloads. For now, you can check the work in progress at our [Roadmap].


  * How do I use the subtitles? 

    The subtitles come in a simple [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip SubRip/SRT] format. Download the lecture videos, and place the subtitle files into the same directory with the video files. When you next open the videos in your favorite player, you should be able to see the subtitles.

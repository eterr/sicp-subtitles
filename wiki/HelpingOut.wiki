Thank you for your interest in helping sicp-subtitles!

If you are watching the videos, help us improve by checking out the existing subtitles from the [Roadmap] page, and trying to use them. If you find any issues, let us know at the [http://code.google.com/p/sicp-subtitles/issues/list issue tracker] or by [http://groups.google.com/group/sicp-subtitles].

If you have more time, you can help with the actual work. Here are the stages:

  # Breaking the video into frames and subtitling (English)
  # Translating into your native language
  # Validating the English transcription and grammar
  # Validating the translation and grammar

Drop us a note at the mailing list and we'll give you access to this wiki and SVN, to be able to update the files. 

The first stage is really hard. If you start doing that, be sure to check out the SubTitling guidelines. Also, you will need software to do this work. Here are a few free programs we use for the task:

  # [http://www.fluffalopefactory.com/miyu/ Miyu] (OS X)
  # [http://gnome-subtitles.sourceforge.net/ gnome-subtitles] (UNIX)
  # [http://www.urusoft.net/products.php?cat=sw&lang=1 Subtitle Workshop] (Win)
